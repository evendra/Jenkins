When entering the jenkins repository file details (https://github.com/evendra/Jenkins.git)
then error was showing that not able to do :git ls-remote -h https://github.com/evendra/Jenkins.git
so when doing git ls-remote -h https://github.com/evendra/Jenkins.git through the server where jenkins is installed then error shows :bash: git: command not found
After this installed Git on server : using yum install git
After this error was removed and when build on jenkins then biuld was successful.

This is testing changes
